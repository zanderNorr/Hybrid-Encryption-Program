Hybrid encrpytion program which uses both asymetic and symettric key encryption and SHA256 hashing for maximum security.

- Symmetric key encrptyion is used by Fernet, which a key is shared between the sender and reciever.

- Asymmetric key encrpyion uses a pair of keys, a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.
